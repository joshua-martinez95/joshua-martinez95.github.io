# Notes:

#1.) [Setup]
First couple of things to work on was installling Git version control system. It was simple to just following the link from the git website. After doing so, a folder was created and used to house my repository.

I already had a git hub. So I just had to make a repository for this class. After that, I had to set my username and email from the git bash. I used these commands: 
```
git config --global user.name “joshua-martinez95”

git config --global user.email “j1995martinez@gmail.com”
```

After making sure my repository folder was synced with my online repository, I was ready to get started with the homepage.

#2.) [Code]
So right off the bat, I started to do a simple html file. I have some history with html early in my college career so I knew the simple command. One thing is though, I have never even heard of bootstrap. 

To get to know bootstrap I used google to download the necessary files to use bootstrp. This is to meet the requirment of no absolute paths. Then I went ahead and played around with bootstraps commands. 

#3.) [Testing]

#4.) [Making Portfolio]
